# Code Snip

Code Snip is a productivity tool for developers. When developers have errors, they can download this extension, which shows a "Copy" button overlay on code snippets within Stack Overflow. This button will copy all of the desired text, creating a more seamless experience from web to terminal or text editor.

# About Extensions
Chrome extensions are a way of enhancing a user's behavior to automate their everyday behavior within the Google Chrome browser. Contemplating about the endless possibilities, my mind always finds itself wanting to automate my routine tasks. Everyday I find myself scouring the web for help with my debugging issues and that was how Code Snip was born.

Using merely HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, I've enhanced the way developers interact with Stack Overflow by adding a 'copy' button to copy user's code from a search results page.
