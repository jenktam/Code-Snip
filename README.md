# Code Snip
Chrome extensions are a way of enhancing a user's behavior to automate their everyday behavior within the Google Chrome browser. Contemplating about the endless possibilities, I thought about how many times I scour the web for help with technical bugs. It would be amazing if helpful code online could be copied with the just the click of a button instead of extra keyboard strokes or right mouse clicks. That was how Code Snip was born.
